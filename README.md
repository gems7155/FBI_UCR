# FBI_UCR
 FBI's UCR data from 1976 to 2018

# Since the original dataset exceeds file upload limitation, the final clean data used is uploaded on github
#Given the magnitude of the data, our primary investigation is on categorical variables such as year, state, offender age, offender sex, and offender race. We grouped seven variables and aggregated the total incidents in the United States to visualize the trends from 1976 to 2018.
